An imaginary stat PseudoPower (PP) is used to calculate item values. Scaling values for stats come from http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/.

## Tunnel Vision ##

This does not take +stamina or mp5/regen into account in determining an item's value. Your shadow priest is your character and if you feel a certain item works better for your play style than another, then go for it.

In order to compare the stats to each other, Shadowpriest.com has traditionally used spellpower as the base. This results in the following PP(Pseudopower or spellpower equivalent) values scaled from http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/wiki/SampleOutputPTR_Details.

  * SPELL\_POWER = 1.00
  * SPELL\_HIT = 1.35
  * SPELL\_CRIT = 0.72
  * SPELL\_HASTE = 0.64
  * BONUS\_INT = 0.22
  * BONUS\_SPI = 0.26
