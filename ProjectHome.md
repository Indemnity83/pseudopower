# SUMMARY #

Based on the theory-crafting done at Shadowpriest.com. The PseudoPower addon will place the calculated PseudoPower (PP) rating of an item directly in the items tooltips. It also includes the rating including hit if applicable (PPH).

# Development Note #

The author of this addon has stopped playing World of Warcraft which makes it very difficult to test changes so development has come to a grinding halt. I would still like to continue to develop the addon as I think it's useful but without a way to test changes I just simply can't. If another developer would like to join the project to help with testing and debugging please let me know though a message or issue ticket. Thanks - Indemnity83

# Installation Guide #

  1. Exit "World of Warcraft" completely
  1. Download the mod
    * Make a folder on your desktop called "My Mods"
    * Save the .zip/.rar files to this folder.
    * If, when you try to download the file, it automatically "opens" it... you need to RIGHT click on the link and "save as..." or "Save Target As".
  1. Extract the file - commonly known as 'unzipping'
    * Windows
      * Windows XP has a built in ZIP extractor. Double click on the file to open it, inside should be the file or folders needed. Copy these outside to the "My Mods" folder.
      * WinRAR: Right click the file, select "Extract Here"
      * WinZip: You MUST make sure the option to "Use Folder Names" is CHECKED or it will just extract the files and not make the proper folders how the Authors designed
    * Mac Users
      * StuffitExpander: Double click the archive to extract it to a folder in the current directory.
  1. Verify your WoW Installation Path. That is where you are running WoW from and THAT is where you need to install your mods.
  1. Move to the Addon folder
    * Open your World of Warcraft folder. (default is C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\)
      * Go into the "Interface" folder.
      * Go into the "AddOns" folder.
      * In a new window, open the "My Mods" folder.
      * The "My Mods" folder should have the "Addonname" folder in it.
      * Move the "Addonname" folder into the "AddOns" folder
  1. tart World of Warcraft
  1. ake sure AddOns are installed
    * Log in
    * At the Character Select screen, look in lower left corner for the "addons" button.
    * If button is there: make sure all the mods you installed are listed and make sure "load out of date addons" is checked.
    * If the button is NOT there: means you did not install the addons properly. Look at the above screenshots. Try repeating the steps or getting someone who knows more about computers than you do to help.

# Translations #

Currently the addon has no Localization, and is US only. If anybody would like to assist me in translating this addon, Please submit a Issue ticket.

# Mac Support #

WoW addons are not platformed based. As such, they can be used on either Mac or PC. You can extract both .zip and .rar files on a Mac using StuffitExpander.
